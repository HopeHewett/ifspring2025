<h1>Madeleines</h1>
<p>
    Madeleines are very small sponge cakes with a distinctive shell-like shape acquired from 
    being baked in pans with shell-shaped depresions. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_(cake)" target="_blank"> from wikipedia</a> </sup>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>
       10 Tablespoons (141 g) unsalted butter cut into pieces <br>
       2 Large eggs at room temperature <br>
       1/2 Cup (100 g) granulates Sugar <br>
       3 Tablespoons light brown sugar firmly packed <br>
       2 Teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
       1/8 Teaspoon salt <br>
       1 1/4 Cup (155 g) all-purpose flour <br>
       1 Zested orange <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375F (190C)</li>
        <li>Spray pan with Baker's Joy, make sure the spray gets into the grooves of the pan.
            I find using a paper towel to spread the spray around works well.</li>
        <li>In a small heatproof bowl, melt 10 Tablespoons of butter. Set aside or leave in microwave to cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugars, avnilla extract, and salt. Whisk vigorously until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Add flour into the egg mixture, about one third of the flour at a time, gently stirring into egg mixture after each addition. The original recipe calls for the 
            flour to be sifted in but I find it works fine without that extra step. Though be sure to be very gentle with mixing in Ingredients from this point on because the 
            dough's consistancy can get ruined easily from over mixing.</li>
        <li>Add the orange zest in but don't mix until the butter is added.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooled melted butter around the edge of the batter. Gently fold into the batter using a spatula until ingredients are thoroughly combined but not overmixed.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by heaping Tablespoon into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Transfer to preheated oven and bake for 9 minutes or until the madeleines are light golden brown and when a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let cool and then serve.</li>
    </ol>
