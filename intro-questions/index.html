        <p>1. Hi! I'm Hope Hewett, I'm a junior studying illustration and art history.</p>
        
        <p>2. I do a lot of drawing silly animals and I tend to work in analog mediums. 
            I am taking this class because it is required for my major.</p>
        
            <p>3. I have no experience with any kind of web design or coding.</p>
        
        <p>4. I hope to learn more about how websites work because it has always been a 
            mystery to me.</p>

        <p>5. I expect designing for a screen will take more preplanning/be less spontaneous than designing on
            paper because you have to figure out what you want before you can code/make it.</p>

        <p>6. I chose <a href="https://us.jellycat.com/" target="_blank"> Jellycat </a> because the website 
        matches the vibe of the brand by feeling whimsical yet simple in design. </p>

        <p>7. I chose <a href="https://parisbaguette.com/" target="_blank"> Paris Baguette </a> as my website
            that shows effective design because it is very easy to order food, find locations, and browse the menu, 
            while still looking very nice and clean.</p>
    
        <p>8. I chose <a href="https://www.graza.co/" target="_blank"> Graza</a> because it is beautiful and it taught me so much
        about olive oil in a fun and engaging way. </p>
