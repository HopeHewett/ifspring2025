<h1>Madeleines</h1>
<p>
    Madeleines are very small sponge cakes with a distinctive shell-like shape acquired from 
    being baked in pans with shell-shaped depresions. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_(cake)" target="_blank"> from wikipedia</a> </sup>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>
       10 Tablespoons (141 g) unsalted butter cut into pieces <br>
       2 Large eggs at room temperature <br>
       1/2 Cup (100 g) granulates Sugar <br>
       3 Tablespoons light brown sugar firmly packed <br>
       2 Teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
       1/8 Teaspoon salt <br>
       1 1/4 Cup (155 g) all-purpose flour <br>
       1 Zested orange <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375F (190C)</li>
        <li>Spray pan with Baker's Joy, make sure the spray gets into the grooves of the pan.
            I find using a paper towel to spread the spray around works well.</li>
        <li>In a small heatproof bowl, melt 10 Tablespoons of butter. Set aside or leave in microwave to cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugars, avnilla extract, and salt. Whisk vigorously until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Add flour into the egg mixture, about one third of the flour at a time, gently stirring into egg mixture after each addition. The original recipe calls for the 
            flour to be sifted in but I find it works fine without that extra step. Though be sure to be very gentle with mixing in Ingredients from this point on because the 
            dough's consistancy can get ruined easily from over mixing.</li>
        <li>Add the orange zest in but don't mix until the butter is added.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooled melted butter around the edge of the batter. Gently fold into the batter using a spatula until ingredients are thoroughly combined but not overmixed.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by heaping Tablespoon into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Transfer to preheated oven and bake for 9 minutes or until the madeleines are light golden brown and when a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let cool and then serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Recipe Websites</h3>
    <p><a href="https://sugarspunrun.com/madeleines/#recipe" target="_blank"> Sugar Spun Run</a> <br>
        I chose this recipe website because it has a lot of good baking recipes. I think this works as a good example of what not to do for web design though because it is a
        nightmare to navigate.
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/" target="blank"> allrecipes</a> <br>
        I chose this recipe website because it is straight forward and easy to navigate. One feature in particular that I think makes it a good refernce is the ability to save recipes to a favorites list.
    <p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes" target="blank"> food network</a> <br>
        I chose this website because I thought it was interesting because recipes are only one aspect of the website. I think the drawback to that is that it feels a bit weird to navigate.

    <h3>Other websites</h3>
    <p><a href="https://stlzoo.org/animals" target="blank"> STL Zoo</a> <br>
     I chose this website because of how easy it is to find nested items. Especially with how animals are sorted into catagories, it is so easy and so nice to get around. 
     I also appreciate how this website has a strong identity with out the design impeding its navigability</p>

     <p><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search" target="blank">The Met (specifically the art search section)</a> <br>
    I chose this website because I really appreciate how easy it is to add filters and search specific areas of the collection. I feel 
    like a lot of recipe websites have very confusing search engines so I think this website provides a good guide for that.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.jstor.org" traget="blank">JSTOR</a> <br>
    I chose JSTOR because I thought it would be really interesting to see a recipe website where it shows pdfs of recipes rather than in page text. I think This
    could work well to store old family recipes or recipes found in books or magazines. </p>
